# 8 Queen Problem - Genetic Programming

This is the mini project 2 for Machine learning. It uses genetic algorithms for generating solutions for the 8 queen problem. It finds solutions for arranging 8 queens on the chess table so none of them can attack each other.

The solutions are stored in *solutions.txt*
The boards for the solutions are stored in *board_solutions.txt*

**Runtime:** 30-120 seconds
**NOTE:** The **check_board_validity.py** is a testing file and can be ignored

To run the code, type the following command:
```
python main.py
```
